#### IMPORTANT ####

The program is intended to be used when you are not actively at your computer. You are responsible if you decide to play another game or use a different software at the same time the program is running.

Please make sure to read everything and follow the directions given for the program.

The program will simulate WASD and Left Click.

The program does not track any inputs, and closing it will completely shut it down. It will not run when it is not open.

*** You need to make sure the setting "Fire" under "Combat" in fortnite is also bound to "Right Shift". The program uses RSHIFT to simulate Left Clicks.

=========================================

#### INSTRUCTIONS ####

1: Install or Verify Python 3.12 is installed. You can get from the microsoft store for free here: https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NCVDN91XZQP?ocid=pdpshare

(You can verify it has installed correctly by opening Command Prompt and entering the following command: "python". It will show you the currently installed version, or give an error if python is not installed.)

2: Press the windows key and type "windows powershell" and open it. Type the following command into powershell exactly: "pip3 install pyKey" and press enter. (This installs the plugin needed to simulate inputs.)

3: Double click "Lego-Fortnite-Afk.bat"

4: Read and follow the directions given in the program.
